_The idea for the project has been elaborate by the BeCode.org training._

## üå± Project description
>Planty is a MERN(Mongo, Express, React, Node.js) stack Web Application. It's an IDLE based in Li√®ge/Luik. The purpose is to collect trees existing in the city and become the biggest owner on the map by buying and locking every trees available.
The player receives a wallet with leafs(the game money) at the beginning and this wallet decreases and increase throughout the game. More explanation in the **[walkthrough](#walk)** .

  <img src="./public/signup2.png" width="360" alt="Preview signup form : color pick">
</p>

First, to start off the game the player have an account. To create an account, it requires : 
- an username
- an email account
- a secure password
- an unique hexadecimal color from the color picker(each player has a color in the game).

  <img src="./public/map.png" width="360" alt="Preview of the map">
  <img src="./public/buy_map.png" width="360" alt="Preview of buy action on the map">
</p>

As the player logs in, he arrives on the map. He can wander around to buy tree and check which tree are available or already owned. He can also check the details of the tree, which we will see as well on the profile below.

  <img src="./public/profile.png" width="360" alt="Preview of the user's profile">
  <img src="./public/singletree.png" width="360" alt="Preview of the trees details">
</p>

- On his profile, the player can check the trees he possesses, modify his personal info and log out. 
- On the tree detailed pages, you can see its personal name (random at the DB creation), its owner, its species, the actual value, the wikipedia page of its species. You can lock the tree to prevent another player to buy it and sell the tree.
- On the tree page, players can post comments and interact with the community.
